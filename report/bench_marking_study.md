This benchmarking study aims to compare the performance of different sentiment analysis and predictive modeling techniques.

**Sentiment Analysis Technique : ** 

   TextBlob

**Predictive Modeling Techniques: **
 
1. Random Forest  
2. Gradient Boosting
3. SVR 
4. XGBoost 

**Methodology** 

1. Data Collection: Tweets and stock prices were collected over a period of 6 months. 

2. Sentiment Analysis: Sentiment analysis was performed using the three techniques mentioned above. 

3. Predictive Modeling: Stock prices were predicted using the three modeling techniques. 

4. Evaluation Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared (R2), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) 

5. Conclusion: The TextBlob technique showed the highest accuracy in sentiment analysis, while the XGBoost model performed best in predictive modeling. Future work will focus on optimizing these models and exploring additional features for improved predictions.
